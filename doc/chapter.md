This is the user manual for **JournalViewer** and **JournalViewer Lite**.  If you wish, you may also download the technical report ([RAL-TR-2016-002](http://purl.org/net/epubs/work/24320199)) which contains the same information. The technical report was produced in March 2016 - for the very latest version of the manual, refer to the documentation on this website.
